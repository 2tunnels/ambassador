**If you are just trying to use Ambassador, don't clone this repo! Go to https://www.getambassador.io/ instead!!**

Ambassador is an open source Kubernetes-native API Gateway built on [Envoy](https://envoyproxy.github.io), designed for microservices. Key features include:

* Ability to flexibly map public URLs to services running inside a Kubernetes cluster
* Authentication
* Simple setup and configuration via a declarative YAML file
* Integrated monitoring
* All the load balancing, observability, and protocol support of Envoy

Ambassador also takes full advantage of Kubernetes for availability and scalability, dramatically simplifying the architecture of Ambassador.
