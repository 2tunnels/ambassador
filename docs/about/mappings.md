(Duplicated from the Features page...) Ambassador is built around the idea of mapping _resources_ (in the REST sense) to _services_ (in the Kubernetes sense). A `resource` is identified by a URL prefix -- for example, you might declare that any URL beginning with `/user/` identifies a "user" resource. A `service` is code running in Kubernetes that can handle the resource you want to map.

(More info about mappings here?)
