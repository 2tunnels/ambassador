Run `testall.sh` in this directory to descend into each 0* directory and run the tests.

- You will need to use Python 3 to run the tests.
- The tests use [`kubernaut`](https://kubernaut.io/). If needed, they will install `kubernaut` for you and walk you through getting a `kubernaut` token.
- The tests will not work unless you've pushed your build to a public `DOCKER_REGISTRY`. See [building instructions](../BUILDING.md).

If you're working with this stuff, we'd love to see you in our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/datawire/ambassador)!
